### 3. STEP THREE - ADD FORM VALIDATION
Implement basic form validation for the 2nd page of the app. Feel free to use either the 
HTML built-in validation capabilities (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation)
or any JavaScript form validation library of your choice.

### 4. BONUS POINTS
#### 4.1 Add a Captcha to the form (e.g. Google ReCaptcha: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/)
#### 4.2 Submit form via JavaScript

### Project template
In the provided repository you will find a project template with assets like images, fonts and 
colors, where you should add the assets that you export from the design specs (see `assets` folder). 
Feel free to use your own configuration if needed.

### Usage
Please install NodeJS 16.15.0 (latest LTS version) (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Once you have installed NodeJS, run following command in the terminal: `npm install` 
After the installation of the dependencies is complete, start the server by running the following 
command in the terminal: `npm start`.
You should see the application running at the following address: http://localhost:8080/

# COMMIT YOUR SOLUTION

### 1. Build the project
To build the project type following commands: `npm run build`.

### 2. Package into .zip file
Compress project folder (without the `node_modules` folder) into: `.zip` or `.7z` archive.

### 3. Send the project back to your recruiter
Contact your recruiter via email and send them the archived project solution.

# FAQ

### 1. Can I use project starters like react-create-app and others?
Yes, you are allowed to use any tech stack that suits you, along with boilerplates and starters.

### 2. Should my project look exactly like the prototype? 
Your implementation should follow as closely as you can the provided prototype. 
However, even if you don't manage to implement the whole prototype, please commit your partial solution for review. 

### 3. Is it mandatory to use npm as dependency manager?
No, you can use `yarn` or `CDN` as well.

### 4. Can I put my project on GitHub instead of sending .zip file?
Of course, just remember to set up your repository as public and attach clear instructions on how to start the project.
